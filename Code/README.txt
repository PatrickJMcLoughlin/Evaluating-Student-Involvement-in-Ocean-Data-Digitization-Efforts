This folder contains R scripts for three main components:
1. Error-checking the digitized marigrams for both Dublin Port and Kilrush.
2. Connecting to the Marine Institute's ERDDAP server to generate marigrams for Kilrush for the years 2019 to 2021.

Overview of code:
Dublin_Port_Error_Checking_Code (R File): This R file script uses the ftide_calc_dubport model to compare predicted tidal data with the actual digitized data (a sample of which is available in the Excel_Data folder). The ftide_calc_dubport model is available upon request. During error checking, there may be offsets between the predicted and digitized data due to factors such as timing differences, tidal phases, amplitudes, and other variables. These discrepancies are acceptable within the context of the analysis. However, the number of high and low tide points in the digitized data should correspond directly with the predicted values in the text file generated, provided the data has been digitized correctly by the student.

Generate_Kilrush_Marigram_Images (R file).  This R file script generates marigrams (tidal graphs) for Kilrush, Ireland, for the year 2021 by fetching tidal data from the Irish National Tide Gauge Network via the ERDDAP server and creating visualizations of tidal heights. The script uses various colours to distinguish different tidal traces in the generated images. To generate marigrams for other years (e.g., 2019 or 2020), simply modify the year(DateTime) == 2021 condition in the filtering sections to match the desired year(s). The script saves images with tidal data for each week in PNG format, with filenames indicating the week number (e.g., kilrush_2021_week_49.png). These marigrams automatically assign colours to the traces based on the date or other variables, such as each day or month. The Astro Tide data is used for student assignments, while the Water Level data is generated in the code but not used in the assignment, although it is available for reference or additional analysis.


Kilrush_Predicted Tide_Error_Checking_Code (R file).  This R file script corrects digitized marigrams for Kilrush (with sample data in the "Excel_Data" folder). It generates the required ftide model for error checking against both predicted and digitized tidal data. Unlike the Dublin Port method, this script provides a more accurate comparison by matching residuals (differences) between predicted and actual data. When run correctly, it generates a text file summary of the residuals, offering insights into the accuracy of the digitized marigrams.
