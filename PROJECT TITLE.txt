PROJECT TITLE
Marigram Error Checking for Dublin Port and Kilrush (Including Marigram Generation Code)

REPOSITORY DESCRIPTION
This repository supports the GY369 Oceanography module at Maynooth University for the academic years 2023-2024 (Phase 1) and 2024-2025 (Phase 2). In this project, students work on digitizing marigram images for Dublin Port and Kilrush.

This code accompanies the research article "Evaluating Student Involvement in Ocean Data Digitization Efforts" and includes the following components:

R Code Scripts
The repository includes R scripts for the following main tasks:

Error-checking Digitized Marigrams:
Scripts to validate digitized marigrams for both Dublin Port and Kilrush by identifying discrepancies in high and low points, assessing digitization accuracy.

Connecting to the Marine Institute's ERDDAP Server:
Scripts for generating marigrams for Kilrush covering the years 2019 to 2021.

Note: The ftide data for Dublin Port, used in error-checking, is not included in this repository but is available upon request. This data allows comparison of predicted tidal heights with digitized data to calculate residuals. Due to timing offsets and other issues, residuals may not always match predicted values, but the code flags discrepancies by identifying high and low points, indicating potential digitization accuracy issues.

Folder Structure
Code:
Contains scripts for generating and validating marigrams.

Excel_Data:
Contains sample student-digitized Excel files for Dublin Port and Kilrush.

Note: Discrepancies between predicted and digitized data for Dublin Port are expected due to timing offsets and other potential factors. However, correctly digitized Kilrush data from recent years should align closely with predictions.
